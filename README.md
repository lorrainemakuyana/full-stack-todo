# My Year Vision Board 

## This is what I learned while building this project 

### Using React Redux 
A reducer is a function that determines changes to the application's state using instructions given to it. Redux uses immutable patterns for state changes, hence,actions will be dispatched that tell the reducer when and how to change the application's state. 

Actions and reducers are usually split into separate files. Actions usually return an object with the action type and any other parameters required to change the state.
